Enqueue node A.
Dequeue node A and mark it as visited.
Enqueue adjacent nodes of A: C, B, D.
Dequeue node C and mark it as visited.
Enqueue adjacent nodes of C: A, B, D.
Dequeue node B and mark it as visited.
Enqueue adjacent nodes of B: A, C, E, G.
Dequeue node D and mark it as visited.
Enqueue adjacent nodes of D: C, A.
Dequeue node E and mark it as visited.
Enqueue adjacent nodes of E: G, F, B.
Dequeue node G and mark it as visited.
